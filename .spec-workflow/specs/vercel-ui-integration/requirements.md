# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vercel UI Integration feature involves importing, setting up, and configuring the Vercel V0 generated UI components into our budgeting application project structure. This feature enables us to leverage modern, professionally designed UI components while maintaining our established architecture and business logic. The integration will provide a working development environment where users can run `npm run dev` and immediately see a functional budgeting application with all core features accessible.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports our desktop-first budgeting application by providing the visual foundation for our dual-currency financial management system. The Vercel V0 generated UI components will deliver the modern, professional interface needed to make complex financial data accessible and engaging for users managing both USD and Mexican peso accounts. This integration accelerates our development timeline while ensuring we maintain the high-quality user experience required for our cross-border financial management platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Structure Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Vercel V0 generated code to be properly integrated into our Next.js project structure, so that I can maintain clean code organization and follow our established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vercel V0 code is imported THEN the system SHALL organize files according to our structure.md specifications
2. IF components are generated THEN the system SHALL place them in the appropriate directories (app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, etc.)
3. WHEN the project is set up THEN the system SHALL maintain our naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities)
4. IF there are conflicts with existing patterns THEN the system SHALL adapt the Vercel code to match our conventions
5. WHEN the structure is complete THEN the system SHALL have a clean, organized codebase ready for development

### Requirement 2: Development Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to run `npm run dev` and see a working application, so that I can immediately start testing and developing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `npm install` THEN the system SHALL install all dependencies without errors
2. IF there are dependency conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them using our tech stack specifications
3. WHEN I run `npm run dev` THEN the system SHALL start the Next.js development server successfully
4. IF the server starts THEN the system SHALL display the application at localhost:3000
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL show all pages and components without errors

### Requirement 3: TypeScript Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Vercel V0 components to be properly typed with TypeScript, so that I can maintain type safety and catch errors during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are imported THEN the system SHALL maintain strict TypeScript compliance
2. IF there are type errors THEN the system SHALL resolve them using our established type definitions
3. WHEN props are defined THEN the system SHALL use our interface patterns (BudgetCardProps, TransactionRowProps, etc.)
4. IF external libraries are used THEN the system SHALL include proper type definitions
5. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL compile without TypeScript errors

### Requirement 4: Component Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Vercel V0 components to integrate seamlessly with our data models and business logic, so that I can build functional features without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use our data model interfaces (Transaction, BudgetCategory, SavingsGoal)
2. IF mock data is provided THEN the system SHALL use realistic financial data that matches our business requirements
3. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide proper event handlers and callbacks
4. IF currency conversion is needed THEN the system SHALL display both USD and original currency amounts
5. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL use our validation patterns with Zod schemas

### Requirement 5: Styling and Theme Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a consistent, professional appearance that matches our design system, so that I can trust the application with my financial data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display the dark theme consistently across all components
2. IF components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use our color scheme (Orange primary, Green success, Red danger)
3. WHEN responsive design is tested THEN the system SHALL work properly on desktop with mobile fallback
4. IF shadcn/ui components are used THEN the system SHALL maintain design consistency
5. WHEN the theme is applied THEN the system SHALL provide a professional, financial-application appearance

### Requirement 6: Navigation and Routing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between different sections of the application, so that I can access all budgeting features from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display the main navigation with all required pages
2. IF I click on navigation items THEN the system SHALL route to the appropriate pages (Dashboard, Budget, Transactions, Savings, Calendar)
3. WHEN pages are loaded THEN the system SHALL display the correct content for each section
4. IF there are routing errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with proper error boundaries
5. WHEN navigation is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the selected state and provide clear visual feedback

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each imported component should have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Modular Design**: Vercel components should be isolated and reusable across different pages
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between Vercel components and our business logic
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between Vercel UI components and our data services

### Performance
- **Initial Load Time**: Application should load within 2 seconds on local development server
- **Component Rendering**: All Vercel components should render without performance issues
- **Bundle Size**: Integration should not significantly increase the overall bundle size
- **Development Server**: Hot module replacement should work smoothly with Vercel components

### Security
- **Code Integrity**: All imported Vercel code should be free from security vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Security**: All dependencies should be up-to-date and secure
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration should prevent runtime errors and security issues
- **Input Validation**: All form components should use proper validation patterns

### Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Vercel components should handle errors gracefully without breaking the application
- **Fallback States**: Components should display appropriate loading and error states
- **Browser Compatibility**: Integration should work across all supported browsers
- **Development Stability**: The development environment should be stable and reliable

### Usability
- **User Experience**: The integrated UI should provide an intuitive, professional user experience
- **Accessibility**: Components should maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Responsive Design**: The application should work properly on desktop with mobile responsiveness
- **Visual Consistency**: All components should follow the established design system
