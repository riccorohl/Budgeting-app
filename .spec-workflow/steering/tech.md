## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Decision Log
1. **Next.js 14 over Create React App**: Chosen for App Router, server components, and better performance. CRA was considered but Next.js offers superior developer experience and production optimization.

2. **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui over Material-UI**: shadcn/ui provides more customization, better TypeScript support, and modern design patterns. Material-UI was considered but shadcn/ui offers better flexibility for custom financial UI components.

3. **Recharts over Chart.js**: Recharts has better React integration, TypeScript support, and modern API. Chart.js was considered but Recharts provides cleaner React patterns and better performance.

4. **React Hook Form + Zod over Formik**: Better TypeScript integration, less re-renders, and schema validation. Formik was considered but React Hook Form offers superior performance and developer experience.

5. **pnpm over npm**: Faster installs, better disk efficiency, and stricter dependency resolution. npm was considered but pnpm provides better performance and reliability.

6. **Exchange Rate API**: Chosen for its simplicity, reliability, and free tier with daily updates. Alternative considered: Fixer.io, but Exchange Rate API has better documentation and simpler integration.

7. **Plaid for US bank integration**: Industry standard for bank connections with excellent security and broad bank support. Alternative considered: Yodlee, but Plaid has better React integration and documentation.

8. **Desktop-First Design**: Prioritizing desktop experience allows for richer data visualization and more complex UI patterns. Mobile responsiveness maintained as progressive enhancement.

## Known Limitations

- **Mexican Bank Integration**: Currently manual entry only for MXN transactions. Future integration with Mexican banking APIs will require additional development and compliance considerations.

- **Offline Functionality**: Limited offline capabilities. Users can view cached data but cannot add new transactions without internet connection.

- **Exchange Rate Accuracy**: Daily updates may not reflect intraday currency fluctuations. This is acceptable for budgeting purposes but not suitable for trading.

- **Mobile App**: Currently web-only. Native mobile apps would require separate React Native or Flutter development.

- **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket implementation for real-time bank data updates. Users must manually refresh or wait for scheduled sync.

- **Data Export**: Limited export formats (JSON, CSV). Future enhancement needed for PDF reports and tax preparation formats.

- **Multi-user Support**: Single-user application. Family sharing features would require significant architectural changes including user management and data sharing.

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Limited SSR due to client-side state management. Future enhancement could include SSR for better SEO and initial load performance.
