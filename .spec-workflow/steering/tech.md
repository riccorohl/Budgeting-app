# Technology Stack

## Project Type
React-based web application with mobile-responsive design for personal budgeting and financial management, specifically designed for cross-border financial management between US and Mexican banking systems.

## Core Technologies

### Primary Language(s)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0+
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ (for development and build tools)
- **Language-specific tools**: npm/yarn for package management, Vite for build tooling

### Key Dependencies/Libraries
- **React 18+**: Core UI framework with hooks and modern patterns
- **React Router 6+**: Client-side routing for SPA navigation
- **Material-UI (MUI) 5+**: Component library for consistent design system
- **React Query (TanStack Query)**: Server state management and caching
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for client-side state
- **React Hook Form**: Form handling and validation
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communications

### Application Architecture
- **Architecture Pattern**: Component-based SPA with separation of concerns
- **State Management**: 
  - Global state (user, settings, exchange rates): Zustand stores
  - Server state (transactions, budgets): React Query
  - Form state: React Hook Form
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design pattern (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional data flow with React hooks and context

### Data Storage (if applicable)
- **Primary storage**: Local Storage for user preferences and offline data
- **Caching**: React Query cache for API responses and exchange rate data
- **Data formats**: JSON for all data exchange and storage
- **Future consideration**: IndexedDB for larger offline datasets

### External Integrations (if applicable)
- **APIs**: 
  - [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) for USD/MXN conversion
  - Plaid API for US bank account integration
  - Future: Mexican banking APIs for MXN transaction import
- **Protocols**: HTTPS/REST for all external API communications
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for bank connections, JWT for user sessions

### Monitoring & Dashboard Technologies (if applicable)
- **Dashboard Framework**: React with Material-UI components
- **Real-time Communication**: Polling for exchange rate updates (daily)
- **Visualization Libraries**: Chart.js for spending trends, progress bars for savings goals
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Query for server state

## Development Environment

### Build & Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Package Management**: npm with lockfile for dependency management
- **Development workflow**: Hot module replacement (HMR) for instant updates

### Code Quality Tools
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint with TypeScript rules and React hooks rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier for consistent code formatting
- **Testing Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for component documentation, Storybook for component showcase

### Version Control & Collaboration
- **VCS**: Git with GitHub for version control
- **Branching Strategy**: Feature branch workflow with main branch protection
- **Code Review Process**: Pull request reviews required before merging

### Dashboard Development (if applicable)
- **Live Reload**: Vite HMR for instant development feedback
- **Port Management**: Vite dev server on configurable port (default 3000)
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Multiple dev instances can run on different ports

## Deployment & Distribution (if applicable)
- **Target Platform(s)**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with mobile responsiveness
- **Distribution Method**: Static hosting on Vercel/Netlify with CDN distribution
- **Installation Requirements**: Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- **Update Mechanism**: Automatic updates through static hosting platform

## Technical Requirements & Constraints

### Performance Requirements
- **Initial Load Time**: < 3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Time to Interactive**: < 5 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB gzipped for initial bundle
- **Exchange Rate Updates**: Daily API calls with 24-hour caching
- **Bank Data Sync**: Real-time updates when user initiates sync

### Compatibility Requirements  
- **Platform Support**: 
  - Desktop: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
  - Mobile: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+, Samsung Internet 13+
- **Dependency Versions**: 
  - Node.js: 18+ (development)
  - React: 18+ (hooks support required)
  - TypeScript: 5.0+ (modern type features)
- **Standards Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA for accessibility, HTTPS everywhere

### Security & Compliance
- **Security Requirements**: 
  - HTTPS only for all communications
  - Secure storage of API keys and sensitive data
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - CSRF protection for forms
- **Compliance Standards**: 
  - PCI DSS considerations for financial data
  - GDPR compliance for EU users
  - Data encryption in transit and at rest
- **Threat Model**: 
  - API key protection
  - XSS prevention
  - Secure bank data handling
  - User data privacy protection

### Scalability & Reliability
- **Expected Load**: 
  - 1,000+ concurrent users
  - 10,000+ API requests per day
  - 100MB+ transaction data per user
- **Availability Requirements**: 
  - 99.5% uptime target
  - Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
  - Offline functionality for basic features
- **Growth Projections**: 
  - Support for 10,000+ users
  - Multiple currency pairs beyond USD/MXN
  - Additional bank integrations

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Decision Log
1. **React + TypeScript**: Chosen for type safety, excellent developer experience, and strong ecosystem for financial applications. Alternative considered: Vue.js, but React has better charting and form libraries.

2. **Vite over Create React App**: Vite provides faster development builds, better tree-shaking, and modern ES modules support. CRA was considered but Vite offers superior performance.

3. **Material-UI over custom CSS**: MUI provides consistent design system, accessibility features, and mobile responsiveness out of the box. Custom CSS would require significant development time for similar results.

4. **Zustand over Redux**: Zustand is simpler, has less boilerplate, and sufficient for the application's state management needs. Redux was considered but adds unnecessary complexity.

5. **React Query for server state**: Provides excellent caching, background updates, and error handling for API calls. Alternative considered: SWR, but React Query has better TypeScript support.

6. **Exchange Rate API**: Chosen for its simplicity, reliability, and free tier with daily updates. Alternative considered: Fixer.io, but Exchange Rate API has better documentation and simpler integration.

7. **Plaid for US bank integration**: Industry standard for bank connections with excellent security and broad bank support. Alternative considered: Yodlee, but Plaid has better React integration and documentation.

8. **Chart.js for visualizations**: Mature library with good React integration and extensive chart types. Alternative considered: D3.js, but Chart.js provides faster development with less complexity.

## Known Limitations

- **Mexican Bank Integration**: Currently manual entry only for MXN transactions. Future integration with Mexican banking APIs will require additional development and compliance considerations.

- **Offline Functionality**: Limited offline capabilities. Users can view cached data but cannot add new transactions without internet connection.

- **Exchange Rate Accuracy**: Daily updates may not reflect intraday currency fluctuations. This is acceptable for budgeting purposes but not suitable for trading.

- **Mobile App**: Currently web-only. Native mobile apps would require separate React Native or Flutter development.

- **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket implementation for real-time bank data updates. Users must manually refresh or wait for scheduled sync.

- **Data Export**: Limited export formats (JSON, CSV). Future enhancement needed for PDF reports and tax preparation formats.

- **Multi-user Support**: Single-user application. Family sharing features would require significant architectural changes including user management and data sharing.
